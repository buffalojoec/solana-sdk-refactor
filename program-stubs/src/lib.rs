//! Logging utilities for Rust-based Solana programs.
//!
//! Logging is the main mechanism for getting debugging information out of
//! running Solana programs, and there are several functions available for doing
//! so efficiently, depending on the type of data being logged.
//!
//! The most common way to emit logs is through the [`msg!`] macro, which logs
//! simple strings, as well as [formatted strings][fs].
//!
//! [`msg!`]: crate::msg!
//! [fs]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/
//!
//! Logs can be viewed in multiple ways:
//!
//! - The `solana logs` command displays logs for all transactions executed on a
//!   network. Note though that transactions that fail during pre-flight
//!   simulation are not displayed here.
//! - When submitting transactions via [`RpcClient`], if Rust's own logging is
//!   active then the `solana_rpc_client` crate logs at the "debug" level any
//!   logs for transactions that failed during simulation. If using
//!   [`env_logger`] these logs can be activated by setting
//!   `RUST_LOG=solana_rpc_client=debug`.
//! - Logs can be retrieved from a finalized transaction by calling
//!   [`RpcClient::get_transaction`].
//! - Block explorers may display logs.
//!

//! [`env_logger`]: https://docs.rs/env_logger
//! [`RpcClient::get_transaction`]: https://docs.rs/solana-rpc-client/latest/solana_rpc_client/rpc_client/struct.RpcClient.html#method.get_transaction
//!
//! While most logging functions are defined in this module, [`Pubkey`]s can
//! also be efficiently logged with the [`Pubkey::log`] function.
//!
//! [`Pubkey`]: crate::pubkey::Pubkey
//! [`Pubkey::log`]: crate::pubkey::Pubkey::log

/// Supports simple strings as well as Rust [format strings][fs]. When passed a
/// single expression it will be passed directly to [`sol_log`]. The expression
/// must have type `&str`, and is typically used for logging static strings.
/// When passed something other than an expression, particularly
/// a sequence of expressions, the tokens will be passed through the
/// [`format!`] macro before being logged with `sol_log`.
///
/// [fs]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/
/// [`format!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/fn.format.html
///
/// Note that Rust's formatting machinery is relatively CPU-intensive
/// for constrained environments like the Solana VM.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use solana_program::msg;
///
/// // The fast form
/// msg!("verifying multisig");
///
/// // With formatting
/// let err = "not enough signers";
/// msg!("multisig failed: {}", err);
